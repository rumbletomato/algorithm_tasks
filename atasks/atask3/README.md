# Algorithm task 3 (atask3)

Given an array of some ordered data and a second array that contains only a part of data from the first array, but unsorted. The task is to sort second array using first array.
 
Solution should be faster than O(n^2).

Example:

`[1,2,3,4,5,6,7], [5,7,3] -> [3,5,7]`

``['one', 'two', 'three', 'four', 'five'], ['three', 'one', 'four'] -> [â€™one', 'three', 'four']
